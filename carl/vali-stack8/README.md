# This is a correct version of reinforced stacking.
vali8.py generating prediction for the validation set, series 7 and 8 for each subject.
vali8sub.py generating prediction for the test set.
vali8 uses future features, so vali8sub itself is not a legit model
vali8 uses channel 2 for filtering
note that vali7 is also legit, the wrong one is stack7
stack8 fixed the problem of stack7
