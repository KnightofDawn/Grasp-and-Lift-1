This is an attempt of the reinforced stacking, I think it is legit

vali7 uses future features so it is not a legal submission itself

stack7 uses predictions from vali1 (legal, from past only) and vali7 (both past and future)
stack7 uses past predictions from either vali7 if no future leakage or vali1 otherwise

stack7 validation 0.953 lb 0.966

# this is wrong. line 84 of stack7sub is wrong. it should be return np.hstack((Xp,Xm,Xt,Xu,Xs))
